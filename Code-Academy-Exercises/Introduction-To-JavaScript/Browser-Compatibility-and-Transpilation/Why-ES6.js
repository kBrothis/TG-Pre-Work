var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = `You can make carbonara with + pasta + , + meat +, and a sauce made with + sauce + .`;


// ES6 is more similar to other object-oriented programming languates making it easier to learn Javascript
// ES6 is easier to read and understand as it requires fewer characters for the same functionality
// ES6 addresses some bugs in ES5;
